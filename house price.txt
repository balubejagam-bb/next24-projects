## House Price Prediction Project Documentation

### 1. **Introduction**

#### 1.1 Project Overview
Provide a brief overview of the project, including its objectives and significance. Explain why predicting house prices is important and what the project aims to achieve.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement
Describe the specific problem the project is addressing. For instance, how accurately predicting house prices can aid buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

#### 1.3 Scope
Outline the scope of the project. What data will be used? Which geographic area or market segment does the project cover? Are there any limitations or constraints?

### 2. **Data Collection**

#### 2.1 Data Sources
List and describe the sources of data used in the project (e.g., real estate websites, government databases, public records).

#### 2.2 Data Description
Provide a detailed description of the data, including:
- Features: What attributes of the houses are included (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms)?
- Data Format: How is the data structured (e.g., CSV files, SQL databases)?
- Data Quality: Discuss any issues with data quality or completeness.

#### 2.3 Data Collection Process
Explain how the data was collected, including any tools or methods used (e.g., web scraping, API calls).

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**

#### 3.1 Data Cleaning
Describe the steps taken to clean the data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.

#### 3.2 Feature Engineering
Explain how new features were created from the raw data, if applicable. This may include creating categorical variables, encoding, or scaling features.

#### 3.3 Data Splitting
Detail how the data was divided into training, validation, and test sets.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### 4.1 Descriptive Statistics
Provide an overview of the data using summary statistics and visualizations.

#### 4.2 Data Visualization
Include charts and graphs that illustrate key patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

#### 4.3 Correlation Analysis
Discuss the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).

### 5. **Modeling**

#### 5.1 Model Selection
Describe the models that were considered (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting).

#### 5.2 Model Training
Explain the process of training the models, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques.

#### 5.3 Model Evaluation
Discuss the metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²) and present the results for each model.

#### 5.4 Model Comparison
Compare the performance of different models and justify the choice of the final model.

### 6. **Results**

#### 6.1 Final Model
Present the final model selected and explain why it was chosen over others.

#### 6.2 Predictions
Discuss the results of the predictions made by the model, including any example predictions and their accuracy.

#### 6.3 Performance Metrics
Provide detailed metrics for the final model and interpret them.

### 7. **Conclusion**

#### 7.1 Summary of Findings
Summarize the key findings of the project, including the effectiveness of the model in predicting house prices.

#### 7.2 Future Work
Suggest potential improvements or next steps for the project. This might include collecting additional data, exploring different modeling techniques, or deploying the model in a real-world application.

### 8. **Appendices**

#### 8.1 Code
Include or reference the code used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This can be provided as a link to a GitHub repository or included in the documentation as needed.

#### 8.2 References
List any sources or references used in the project, such as research papers, textbooks, or websites.

#### 8.3 Glossary
Define any technical terms or jargon used in the documentation.
